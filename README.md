# ascension-from-beneath-the-abyss

A LÖVE game for the BaconGameJam 09 themed "depth". An experiment in darkness,
light and patience. Can you ascend from beneath the Abyss?

Arrow keys, WASD or D-pad to move; space or start button to pause.

The GNU/Linux release requires the LÖVE framework (http://love2d.org/)
and should be run with the command

    love --fused ascension.love

where the "--fused" argument is required to access the configuration file
where you may change the default resolution and sound options.

The Windows executable comes with everything necessary to run it and
doesn't require any additional arguments.
